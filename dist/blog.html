              Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).
              Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
              Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.

            <h1>A 1923 earthquake changed the fate of sushi</h1>
            <p>
              The tragedy and devastation brought about by the 1923 earthquake had far-reaching effects and caused the land prices to decline significantly.     
              It offered an opportunity for the sushi vendors to take their stalls indoors and this led to brick-and-mortar sushi-ya.  
              By the 1950s, sushi was mostly served indoors at restaurants.

            <h1>Sushi in Japan reflects the seasons</h1>
            <p>
              In Japan, a sushi dinner often reflects the season’s bounty and gives diners a feel of the spring, fall, winter or summer.
              Thus, the sushi chefs avoid the out-of-season sushi and choose only the fattest and tastiest ones that are getting ready to reproduce in that season.
